Understand the ANATOMY of any Tool and then use it in a right way(Natural Language):
hey gpt what are your capabilities

**GPT-5 Prompt Framework for Product / App Development**
1️⃣ Role (Who I Should Be)
- Define what you want me to act as — this sets my perspective and tone.
Example:
“Act as a senior full-stack web app developer and UX strategist specializing in AI-powered tools.”

2️⃣ Task (What You Want Built or Planned)
- State the main goal clearly — the problem, product, or outcome you want.
Example:
“Design a mobile-friendly AI Resume Optimizer web app that analyzes uploaded resumes, gives job-fit insights, and recommends skill improvements.”

3️⃣ Context (Important Details, Scope, and Constraints)
- Give background info, user type, purpose, and boundaries.
You can list 5–7 bullets with specific conditions.

Example:
Target audience: freshers and entry-level graduates.
- Must work fully in a single HTML file (frontend + embedded JS logic).
- Should include sections for resume upload, analysis summary, and insights visualization.
- Keep the design minimal, responsive, and professional.
- Use neutral colors, modern fonts, and soft animations.

4️⃣ Reasoning (Guidelines, Logic, Validation Rules)
- Tell me how to think or what to prioritize before producing output.
Example:
- Ensure file input and text parsing logic are implemented using vanilla JS.
- Validate resumes for missing skills, experience gaps, and keyword alignment.
- Optimize layout for both desktop and mobile.
- Cross-check that all features run client-side (no backend dependency).

5️⃣ Output Format (How You Want Results Displayed)
- Clearly state what format I should return — code, document, table, plan, etc.
Example:
“Return the complete code in one HTML file with internal CSS and JS sections, properly commented for clarity.”

6️⃣ Stop Condition (When the Task Is Complete)
Tell me what defines “done.”
Example:
“The task is complete when the final output is a fully functional, mobile-responsive HTML file containing all UI sections, logic, and styling in one file.”
